# Warehouse Save Bug Fix - Comprehensive Report

## Executive Summary
Fixed a critical bug where **warehouse selection was not being saved** when editing products in two sections:
- ✅ **"Поступление товара"** (Products Inflow / Incoming Stock)
- ✅ **"Приемка"** (Acceptance / Reception)

The fix involved adding the missing `warehouseId` field to both update request models and passing it from the UI forms to the API.

---

## The Problem

### User Experience
When users edited a product and tried to change its warehouse:
1. The warehouse dropdown showed the current warehouse correctly
2. Users could select a different warehouse
3. **BUT** when saving, the new warehouse was not persisted in the database

### Technical Root Cause
The `UpdateProductInflowRequest` and `UpdateAcceptanceRequest` data models were **missing the `warehouseId` field**.

This meant that even though:
- ✅ The UI had `_selectedWarehouseId` variable
- ✅ The user could change it via dropdown
- ❌ It was **NOT** being included in the API request

---

## The Solution

### Architecture Pattern Used
The fix follows the same pattern already working in "Товары в пути" (Products In Transit):

```
Frontend                    Backend
   ↓                          ↓
User selects warehouse → _selectedWarehouseId
   ↓
Creates UpdateRequest → passes warehouseId
   ↓
API receives & saves → warehouse is updated ✅
```

### Changes Made

#### 1. Product Inflow Model
**File:** `lib/features/products_inflow/data/models/product_inflow_model.dart`

```diff
  const factory UpdateProductInflowRequest({
    String? name,
    String? description,
    dynamic attributes,
    @JsonKey(name: 'calculated_volume') String? calculatedVolume,
    String? quantity,
    @JsonKey(name: 'transport_number') String? transportNumber,
+   @JsonKey(name: 'warehouse_id') int? warehouseId,  // ← ADDED
    @JsonKey(name: 'producer_id') int? producerId,
```

#### 2. Product Inflow Form
**File:** `lib/features/products_inflow/presentation/pages/product_inflow_form_page.dart`

```diff
  final updateRequest = UpdateProductInflowRequest(
    name: _nameController.text.isEmpty ? null : _nameController.text,
    quantity: _quantityController.text,
    calculatedVolume: _calculatedVolumeController.text.isEmpty ? null : _calculatedVolumeController.text,
    transportNumber: _transportNumberController.text.isEmpty ? null : _transportNumberController.text,
+   warehouseId: _selectedWarehouseId,  // ← ADDED
    producerId: _selectedProducerId,
```

#### 3. Acceptance Model
**File:** `lib/features/acceptance/data/models/acceptance_model.dart`

```diff
  const factory UpdateAcceptanceRequest({
    String? name,
    String? description,
    dynamic attributes,
    @JsonKey(name: 'calculated_volume') String? calculatedVolume,
    String? quantity,
    @JsonKey(name: 'transport_number') String? transportNumber,
+   @JsonKey(name: 'warehouse_id') int? warehouseId,  // ← ADDED
    @JsonKey(name: 'producer_id') int? producerId,
```

#### 4. Acceptance Form
**File:** `lib/features/acceptance/presentation/pages/acceptance_form_page.dart`

```diff
  final request = UpdateAcceptanceRequest(
    producerId: _selectedProducerId,
+   warehouseId: _selectedWarehouseId,  // ← ADDED
    quantity: _quantityController.text,
    name: _nameController.text,
```

| Товары в пути | ✅ Save warehouse | ✅ Save warehouse | ✅ Working |
| Поступление товара | ✅ Save warehouse | ❌ Lose warehouse | ❌ Broken |
| Приемка | ✅ Save warehouse | ❌ Lose warehouse | ❌ Broken |

### After Fix

## Implementation Details

### What Changed in the Data Layer
The `UpdateProductInflowRequest` and `UpdateAcceptanceRequest` now include `warehouseId` just like:
- `CreateProductInflowRequest` (create requests already had it)
- `UpdateProductInTransitRequest` (was already correct)

### What Changed in the Presentation Layer
The form methods now pass `warehouseId` to the update requests:

```dart
// Before
warehouseId: _selectedWarehouseId,  // ❌ Missing

// After
warehouseId: _selectedWarehouseId,  // ✅ Now included
```

### Freezed Code Generation
After adding the fields to the models, code was regenerated:
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This updated the Freezed factory constructors and JSON serialization code.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Models compile without errors
- [x] Forms compile without errors  
- [x] Freezed code generation succeeds
- [x] No analyzer errors in modified files
- [x] Logic matches "Товары в пути" pattern
- [x] warehouseId is optional (nullable) for forward compatibility

## Files Modified

1. **lib/features/products_inflow/data/models/product_inflow_model.dart**
   - Added `warehouseId` field to `UpdateProductInflowRequest`

2. **lib/features/products_inflow/presentation/pages/product_inflow_form_page.dart**
   - Added `warehouseId: _selectedWarehouseId` to update request builder

3. **lib/features/acceptance/data/models/acceptance_model.dart**
   - Added `warehouseId` field to `UpdateAcceptanceRequest`

4. **lib/features/acceptance/presentation/pages/acceptance_form_page.dart**
   - Added `warehouseId: _selectedWarehouseId` to update request builder

---

## Migration Notes

### For Backend Teams
No backend changes required - the API should already support `warehouse_id` in update requests (it works for "Товары в пути").

### For Testing Teams
1. **Test Product Inflow Edit:**
   - Create a product in warehouse A
   - Edit it and change to warehouse B
   - Save and verify warehouse changed to B

2. **Test Acceptance Edit:**
   - Create a product in warehouse A
   - Edit it and change to warehouse C  
   - Save and verify warehouse changed to C

3. **Regression Test:**
   - Verify creating products still saves warehouse correctly
   - Verify other fields are still saved correctly when warehouse is changed

---

## Performance Impact
None - this is just adding one field to an existing request object.
