# Debug Receipts Feature

## Current Implementation Status

I have implemented comprehensive debugging for the receipts feature. Here's what the logs will now show:

### Data Source Debug Output:
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsDataSource: Making request to [BASE_URL]`
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsDataSource: Query params: {...}`
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsDataSource: Trying endpoint: /receipts`
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsDataSource: âœ… Success with endpoint: /receipts` (or failure)
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsDataSource: Response data type: Map<String, dynamic>`

### Repository Debug Output:
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsRepository: Making request with params - page: 1, perPage: 15...`
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsRepository: Raw response received: {...}`
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsRepository: Response keys: [...]`
- `ðŸ”µ ReceiptsRepository: DataList length: 0`

### Fallback Mechanism:
The system now tries multiple endpoints in order:
1. `/receipts` (primary endpoint from OpenAPI)
2. `/products-in-transit` (alias endpoint from OpenAPI)
3. `/products` (fallback using existing working endpoint)

### What to Look For:

1. **Authentication Issues**: Look for `401 Unauthorized` responses
2. **Missing Endpoints**: Look for `404 Not Found` responses  
3. **Empty Data**: Look for "DataList length: 0" messages
4. **Parsing Errors**: Look for error messages during JSON parsing
5. **Network Issues**: Look for connection timeout or network errors

### Expected Behavior:

When you open the "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ñ€Ñ‹ Ð² Ð¿ÑƒÑ‚Ð¸" section, you should see detailed logs in the console showing:
- Which endpoint was tried
- What response was received
- How many items were parsed
- Any errors encountered

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **No data showing**: Check if the API endpoints return empty arrays
2. **Parse errors**: Check if the JSON structure matches our models
3. **Auth errors**: Check if the user token is valid
4. **Network errors**: Check if the API server is accessible

## Next Steps:

Run the app and navigate to the "Ð¢Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ñ€Ñ‹ Ð² Ð¿ÑƒÑ‚Ð¸" section. The console logs will show exactly what's happening with the API requests and responses.
